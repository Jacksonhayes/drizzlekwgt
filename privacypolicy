Privacy Policy for Drizzle KWGT
This Privacy Policy governs the use of the Drizzle KWGT application ("Drizzle KWGT" or "the Application"), which operates as a third-party widget preset pack for the required host application, KWGT Kustom Widget Maker (Kustom Industries).

This policy is effective as of October 13, 2025.

1. Introduction
Drizzle KWGT is a collection of pre-designed templates (presets) and assets for use with the KWGT Kustom Widget Maker application. As a widget pack, Drizzle KWGT contains no independent code for data collection or transmission.

The developer of Drizzle KWGT is committed to protecting your privacy.

2. Information Collection and Use
2.1. No Personal Data Collection by Drizzle KWGT
Drizzle KWGT does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) or usage data about its users.

2.2. Data Processing for Widget Display (Local Device Use Only)
To function, the Drizzle KWGT presets rely entirely on the capabilities and permissions granted to the KWGT Kustom Widget Maker host application and the Android Operating System.

The data displayed by Drizzle KWGT presets (such as current time, date, weather, battery level, or step count) is sourced locally from your device's operating system or through the KWGT host app. This data is processed locally on your device solely for the purpose of widget visualization and is never transmitted to us, the developers of Drizzle KWGT.

2.3. Log Data and Analytics
Drizzle KWGT does not include any analytics or log collection services. However, standard non-personally identifiable usage data (e.g., install status, app version, country of download) may be collected by Google Play Store as part of its platform services.

3. Third-Party Services
Drizzle KWGT is dependent on the following third-party services, whose Privacy Policies you should review:

Google Play Services: For distribution and payment processing.

KWGT Kustom Widget Maker: The host application required to run the widgets. The KWGT Kustom Widget Maker application has its own Privacy Policy regarding the use of device data (e.g., location for weather, fitness data) which must be agreed to by the user.

4. Children's Privacy
Drizzle KWGT is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.

5. Security
While Drizzle KWGT itself does not transmit data, we remind you that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. You should be familiar with the security and privacy settings of your mobile device and the KWGT host application.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
